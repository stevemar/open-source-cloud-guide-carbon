In other words, how does AI made cloud offerings better?_\n\nArtificial intelligence leverages computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind. AI combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem-solving.  Integrating AI and machine learning technologies with cloud environments is an increasingly common scenario, driven by use of microservices and the need to scale rapidly. \n\nAI developers take the models that data scientists create and make them into deployable models that can be used in applications. \n\n## Problems?\n\nDevelopers are faced with the challenge to not only build machine learning applications, but to ensure that they run well in production in cloud-native and hybrid cloud environments. \n\n_EM:::::: This might be too much information but adding it for now:_\n\nMoving an application from a Jupyter notebook<!--EM: is all AI modeling done in Jupyter notebooks?--> to a production environment requires numerous components to work together. These components cover a wide range of tasks that developers and administrators have to manage, including microservices frameworks, code analysis support, monitoring/logging support, continuous integration, secure access to service credentials, UI components, DevOps pipeline, Kubernetes YAML files, manage API access to other business logic components, and so on.\n\n## How is AI related to hybrid cloud in general?\n\nI assume it's b/c teams can choose the cloud that works for their workloads/use cases and then extend their oferings with AI services. So those services need to work well with any cloud.
